# Overview

An often discussed topic under the field of persuasive technology is the issue of dark design patterns. First coined in 2010 by UX designer Harry Brignull, dark patterns are deceptive user interactions designed to exploit human psychology which leads users into making choices they otherwise might not make. In mobile gaming, "dark patterns" refer to design strategies employed in games that are meant to trick players into taking actions they might not have otherwise opted for.

This exploratory study investigates the degree to which users recognize the presence of persuasive elements and how users perceive these elements in mobile games. Specifically, it aims to answer two questions:

1) Are users typically aware of and able to recognize dark patterns in mobile games while playing? 

2) How do dark patterns in mobile games impact users’ emotions and behaviors?
